### Hi there I'm Kaz👋

Seasoned mobile engineer with expertise in iOS. Committed to user-centered software solutions, I prioritize intuitive and seamless user interface experiences.
My entrepreneurial background in starting a successful startup demonstrates my passion for tackling complex challenges outside my comfort zone. 
I'm moving to Vancouver this July and seeking for a full-time job there 🇨🇦

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and doggie (Saku) 🐶
